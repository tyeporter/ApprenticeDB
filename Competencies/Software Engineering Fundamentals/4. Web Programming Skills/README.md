### Demonstration

There are two projects that I worked on that demonstrates web programming skills:
-  [üèó Finance](https://github.com/me50/tyeporter/tree/cs50/problems/2022/x/finance) - Python / Flask project I worked on in [CS50 Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x)
    - This project was assigned for the second-to-last module - **"Flask"** - of CS50. The goal for the project was to build an application that allowed users to manage a fake stock portfolio; basically a stock portfolio simulator that's pre-loaded with $10,000. 
- [üèó NgStore](https://github.com/4orter/Learning/tree/main/Udacity/Fullstack%20JavaScript%20Nanodegree/NgStore) - Angular project I worked on in the [Full Stack JavaScript program](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-javascript-developer-nanodegree--nd0067)
    - This project was assigned for the 3rd module - **"Angular Fundamentals"** - of Full Stack JavaScript. The goal was to build a frontend application for a fictitious storefront which allowed users to do common tasks such as view products, add products to cart, remove products from cart, and submit orders.

#### **OBJECTIVES & OUTCOMES**

The reason for building the [üèó Finance](https://github.com/me50/tyeporter/tree/cs50/problems/2022/x/finance) project was to showcase the backend skills gained from the **"Flask"** module of CS50. Topics covered in this section include:
- Creating web apps using Python and Flask
- Create routes so users can access resources
- Rendering HTML forms for getting input from the user
- Rendering Jinja templates to display dynamic web content in Flask apps
- Writing endpoints for GET/POST requests
- Using the Model-View-Controller pattern to organize applications
- Handling form validation
- Using sqlite to persist submitted user data
- Maintaining user login state using sessions

This training allowed me to build simple backend applications that respond to user requests, sign users up using forms, handle form validation by checking request data, store user data using databases, and easily maintain user sessions using the `flask_session` library.

The reason for building the [üèó NgStore](https://github.com/4orter/Learning/tree/main/Udacity/Fullstack%20JavaScript%20Nanodegree/NgStore) project was to prove that I had gained the necessary frontend skills from the **"Angular Fundamentals"** module of Full Stack JavaScript to build (at least) a fictitious storefront. Topics covered in this section include:
- Angular Overview and the Angular CLI
- Angular Components
- Angular Modules
- Angular Templates
- The Component Lifecycle
- Event Binding
- Sending Data Between Components
- Routing in Angular
- Angular Observables and Handling Global State
- Form Validation in Angular

After this training, I was able to build single-page applications in Angular that keeps state synced between page components using observables and event binding.

#### **PROJECT REQUIREMENTS**

As per the requirements for the [üèó Finance](https://github.com/me50/tyeporter/tree/cs50/problems/2022/x/finance) project, the application needed to: 
- Allow users to sign up for a stock portfolio account
- Allow users to view real-time stock prices using the [IEX Exchange API](https://www.iexexchange.io/products/market-data-connectivity)
- Allow users to get a "quote" by looking up a stock's current price
- Allow users to simulate "buying" and "selling" stocks
- Allow users to see their gains and losses
- Allow users to see a history of their transactions

---- 

As per the requirements for the [üèó NgStore](https://github.com/4orter/Learning/tree/main/Udacity/Fullstack%20JavaScript%20Nanodegree/NgStore) project, the application needed to:
- Show a product list page that display products that user can view 
- Allows users to view product details page where they can view more information about the product
- Ability for users to add products to their cart and view shopping cart items
- Allow users to checkout by providing their details (email, name, address, and payment details)
- Allow users to confirm their order by showing a order confirmation page after checking out
