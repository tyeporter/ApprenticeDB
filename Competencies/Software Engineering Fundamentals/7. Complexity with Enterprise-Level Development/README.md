### Explanation

There are several challenges we have to consider when developing for large-scale enterprise systems such as: 
- Gathering and understand the requirements for a system / product
- Understanding functional requirements and quality attributes of the system
- Ability to learn new technologies on the fly
- Consulting with the right people where our expertise is not so strong
- Understanding system constraints and what could be done within the time frame
- Ability to navigate different cross-team communication styles
- Timely delivery of a product, feature, or service
- And many more...

### Example
An example that I can go to is when I worked on the ZScalar project. There were a few complex situations that I have to deal with and navigate while working in this project such as:
- *Gathering and clearly understanding new requirements*
    - **Solution**: I spent a week meeting with my project manager to go over requirements, share my solutions and understanding, and testing several ideas
    - **Outcome**: I learned how to be proactive about getting clarity on project requirements before starting on the work
- *Learning new technology on the fly*
    - **Solution**: I spent two weeks going over tutorials, demos, and documentation to fill the knowledge gap that came along with being new to a project / technology
    - **Outcome**: I learned how to decipher between what's needed and what not needed for the project I'm working on; how to not waste time learning unnecessary topics
- *Ability to communicate internationally and cross-team*
    - **Solution**: I spent every morning meeting with the team in Bangalore so that we could clarify end-to-end requirements, test solutions, and make sure everything is working as expeected
    - **Outcome**: I gained an understanding of how cross-team / international communication works at the enterprise level, and how to use technology to deal with communication barriers
- *Ability to ask questions to the right people*
    - **Solution**: I stayed in constant communication with the SRE team to ask questions about the technologies I was unfamiliar with
    - **Outcome**: I was able to get a better understanding of how the system worked and how different parts of the system communicate with each other to make the overall product
- *Ability to deliver features on time*
    - **Solution**: I reached out to the people I needed to in order to get new features to production on time
    - **Outcome**: I gained a good understanding of how rigorous the approval process is for getting features into production while helping the company deliver on their promises to their customers
