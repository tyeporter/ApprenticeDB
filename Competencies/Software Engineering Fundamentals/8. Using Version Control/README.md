### Explanation
Version control software like Git allow teams to track and document code over time. This includes:
- Creating repositories to store projects and codebases
- Using branches to help divide work and from preventing the main branch from being effected
- Using commits to add changes to a branch
- Making pull requests to merge changes in one branch into another
- Resetting or revert commits for going back to a previous state
- Creating tags for labelling / versioning software during a specific change  
- etc.

Services like Github and Gitlab improves on Git by providing servers, a GUI, and many other tools that teams around the globe can use to collaborate on software projects. This makes delivering software more social and efficient.

### Example 
Every project I worked on during the apprentice involved using git. For example, for the UI automation project, I used git everyday to:
- Create branches for specific tickets / tasks / work
- Make necessary changes to my branch
- Create pull request with details explaining work done and referencing ticket
- Merge changes once approve by a designated team member 
- Review pull requests created by other team members and requesting changes if needed

All of these thing allowed me to become a better social coder as well as, understand how git plays an integral role in the software development lifecycle.
