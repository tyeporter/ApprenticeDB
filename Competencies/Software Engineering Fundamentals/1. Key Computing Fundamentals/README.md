### Demonstration

While taking Harvard's [CS50 Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x), I was able to learn key computer programming fundamentals by watching lectures, completing labs and problem sets, and building a final project that was graded by course assistants. Also, apart of the computer fundamentals section of the apprenticeship was learning the fundamentals of networking in the [Networking Concepts and Protocols](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/network-concepts-protocols-cert/table-of-contents) course.

#### **OBJECTIVES & OUTCOMES**

The reason for doing problems sets and projects in [CS50 Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x) was to make sure that I could understand the programming concepts that were taught in each section. Some of the topics covered in the course included:
- Data types, operators, conditional statements, loops, the command line, functions, variables and scope, arrays, and the command line using C
- Algorithm concepts such as Big O notation, linear search, binary search, bubble sort, selection sort, recursion, and merge sort
- Memory address, hexadecimal, pointers, memory allocation, call stacks, and file pointers
- Data structures such as structs, linked lists, hash tables, tries, queues, and stacks
- Programming in Python
- Relational databases and SQL basics
- Basics on web programming with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Backend programming with Python and Flask

After the course, I was able to:
- Understand key computer concepts more clearly and how computers make decisions
- Understand that everything in a computer revolves around binary, bits, and bytes and that different programs translate those bits in their own way
- Understand how algorithms can help us write more efficient programs
- Understand databases, how they work, and how to create them
- Understand the basics of servers, networking, and web programming

#### **PROJECT REQUIREMENTS**

[üèó Recover](https://github.com/me50/tyeporter/blob/cs50/problems/2022/x/recover/recover.c) was one of the many problems sets I worked on in [CS50 Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x). This problems set was given after the lecture on computer memory and file pointers. As per the requirements, I needed to recover JPEG images from a FAT memory card file in which the images were "accidentally" deleted. This involved needing to:
- Read data from the memory card file that was given
- Read the file in 512 byte chunks and store in buffer array
    - If the file starts with a JPEG header (`0xff 0xd8 0xff <0xe0-Oxef>`) then create a new JPEG file and start writing bytes in the JPEG file until:
        - We reached a new JPEG header
        - We reached the end of the memory card file
- Verify that the images were recovered by viewing them in a program that supports JPEG

After doing this problem set, I was able to:
- Gain insight into how files, block size, and file formats work
- Work with memory addresses and pointers in C
- Work with hexadecimal to evaluate the contents of a file
- Use variables, logical operators, conditions, and loops to make decisions
- Read and write to files using C

[üèó Tasks](https://github.com/me50/tyeporter) is the final graded project I worked on for Harvard's [CS50 Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x). This project was given for me to showcase any of the skills tha I had gained from the course. As a developer who's more inclined to work on UI / UX projects, I decided to create a frontend application using:
- HTML (Markup Language) [*Proficient*]
- CSS (Stylesheet Language) [*Proficient*]
- JavaScript (Web Programming Language) [*Proficient*]
- React (Frontend Web Library) [*Proficient*]
- Redux (Application State Library) [*Intermediate*]
- Ionic (UI Component Library) [*Beginner*]

After building this project, I was able to:
- Learn to gather requirements for a project
- Understand ho to choose the right technology stack for the job
- Understand how to handle global state in a frontend application
- Understand how to persist data on the frontend using the browser's local storage
