### Explanation
Clean coding behaviors involve using practices and principle that make our code more clear, reusable, and efficient. There are several principles that we can use to keep our code "clean" such as:
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) 
- SOLID
- MVC (Model-View-Controller)
- MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- Clean Architecture
- Code Documentation
- Naming Conventions
- And more ...

Adhering to clean coding behaviors will allow us to: 
- Keep code organized, readable, and understandable by using an architecture and / or structural pattern
- Quickly understand what a variable, method, or class does by reading its name and / or documentation
- Prevent duplication by using concepts like classes, generics, interfaces, and higher-order functions
- Prevent code complexity and confusion by using the single responsible principle in classes, modules, and functions
